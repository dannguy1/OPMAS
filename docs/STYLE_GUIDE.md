# Documentation Style Guide

## General Guidelines

### File Organization
- Use lowercase with hyphens for filenames (e.g., `setup-guide.md`).
- Place files in appropriate directories based on their purpose.
- Keep related documentation together.
- Use clear, descriptive filenames.

### Document Structure
1. **Title** (H1)
2. **Introduction** - Brief overview of the document's purpose.
3. **Table of Contents** (for longer documents).
4. **Main Content** - Organized with clear headings.
5. **Examples** - Where applicable.
6. **References** - Links to related documentation.
7. **Version Information** - At the bottom of each document.

### Markdown Formatting

#### Headers
```markdown
# Main Title (H1)
## Section (H2)
### Subsection (H3)
#### Minor Section (H4)
```

#### Code Blocks
- Use triple backticks with language specification.
- Include comments for clarity.
```python
# Example Python code
def example_function():
    """Documentation string."""
    return True
```

#### Lists
- Use ordered lists for sequential steps.
- Use unordered lists for related items.
- Indent nested lists with 2 spaces.

#### Links
- Use relative paths for internal links.
- Include descriptive text in link.
```markdown
[Link Text](relative/path/to/file.md)
```

### Writing Style

#### Language
- Use clear, concise language.
- Write in present tense.
- Use active voice.
- Avoid jargon unless necessary.

#### Technical Content
- Include code examples where relevant.
- Explain complex concepts.
- Use diagrams for visual explanation.
- Include error handling examples.

#### Version Information
Add at the bottom of each document:
```markdown
---
Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Specific Guidelines

### Code Documentation
- Include purpose and usage examples.
- Document parameters and return values.
- Include error handling.
- Add comments for complex logic.

### API Documentation
- Document all endpoints.
- Include request/response examples.
- Document error codes.
- Include authentication requirements.

### Configuration Documentation
- Document all configuration options.
- Include default values.
- Explain impact of changes.
- Provide examples.

### Tutorial Documentation
- Start with prerequisites.
- Break into clear steps.
- Include verification steps.
- Provide troubleshooting tips.

### API Endpoint Naming Conventions
- Use plural forms for all endpoint names (e.g., `agents`, `users`, `devices`).
- Ensure all endpoint files and related documentation follow this convention.
- Avoid mixing singular and plural forms in endpoint definitions.
- Update any existing code to adhere to this standard to prevent confusion and maintain consistency.

## Best Practices

### Documentation Maintenance
- Keep documentation up to date.
- Review regularly.
- Update version numbers.
- Remove outdated information.

### Cross-Referencing
- Link to related documentation.
- Avoid circular references.
- Use relative paths.
- Keep links current.

### Examples
- Use realistic examples.
- Include edge cases.
- Show error handling.
- Provide complete solutions.

### Diagrams
- Use Mermaid for flowcharts.
- Include alt text.
- Keep diagrams simple.
- Update with code changes.

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- Markdown editor with preview.
- Diagram creation tools.
- Code syntax highlighting.
- Version control system.

### Templates
- Use provided templates for consistency.
- Customize as needed.
- Maintain version information.
- Include required sections.

## Review Process

### Documentation Review
1. Technical accuracy.
2. Completeness.
3. Clarity.
4. Formatting.
5. Links.
6. Examples.
7. Version information.

### Update Process
1. Create branch.
2. Make changes.
3. Update version.
4. Review.
5. Merge.
6. Update changelog.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

### Avoiding Duplicate Functions and Circular Fixes
1. **Review Existing Code**: Before adding new functions or making changes, thoroughly review the existing codebase to avoid duplicating functionality.
2. **Use Version Control**: Always commit changes to version control (e.g., Git) to track modifications and easily roll back if necessary.
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test changes incrementally after each modification to catch issues early and avoid compounding errors.
4. **Document Changes**: Keep a log of changes made, including the rationale behind each change, to maintain clarity and avoid confusion.
5. **Avoid Circular Dependencies**: Be mindful of circular dependencies between modules. Use dependency injection or refactor code to break circular references.
6. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Follow consistent naming conventions for functions, classes, and variables to reduce confusion and improve readability.
7. **Code Reviews**: Implement a code review process to catch potential issues before they are merged into the main codebase.
8. **Automated Testing**: Use automated tests to validate changes and ensure that new code does not break existing functionality.
9. **Refactor Regularly**: Regularly refactor code to improve structure and reduce technical debt, making it easier to maintain and extend.
10. **Stay Organized**: Keep the project structure organized and modular to facilitate easier navigation and understanding of the codebase.

### Conclusion
By adhering to these best practices, we can avoid the pitfalls of duplicate functions and circular fixes, ensuring a more efficient and maintainable codebase.
