# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OPMAS needs to handle multiple autonomous agents, each with their own responsibilities and communication patterns. The system must be scalable, maintainable, and allow for independent deployment of components.

## Decision
We will adopt a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **Core Engine**
   - Handles agent execution and coordination
   - Manages rule processing
   - Communicates with agents via NATS

2. **Management API**
   - Provides REST API for system management
   - Handles configuration and monitoring
   - Uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage

3. **Frontend**
   - React-based single-page application
   - Material UI for consistent design
   - TypeScript for type safety

## Consequences

### Positive
- Independent scaling of components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better fault isolation

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for service discovery
- More complex deployment process
- Potential network latency between services

## Implementation Notes
- Use Docker for containerization
- Implement health checks for all services
- Set up centralized logging
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement circuit breakers for service communication
